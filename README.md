# `shibboleth-mda-docker`

A container image for use in experimenting
with the [Shibboleth][] Metadata Aggregator product
([MDA][]).

[Shibboleth]: https://shibboleth.net
[MDA]: https://shibboleth.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MA1/overview

The container image is available for `linux/amd64` and
`linux/arm64` platforms and incorporates:

- Amazon Linux 2
- Amazon Corretto 17
- The current SNAPSHOT version of Shibboleth MDA 1.0.0, at
  `/opt/mda`.
- `git`
- `opensc`
- `openssl`
- `softhsm`
- `wget`

If you'd find additional tools useful for evaluations, please
raise an [issue][] on the GitHub [repository][].

When you run the container, an initialisation script
sets up a user environment (in `/home/user`,
as `user` 1000:1000) and opens a command prompt
from which the MDA's command-line can be invoked as
`mda.sh` in the usual way.

## Quick start

You can run a container based on this image as follows:

```bash
docker run --rm -it --pull always ianayoung/shibboleth-mda-docker
```

Or, using `podman` instead of `docker`:

```bash
podman run --rm -it --pull always docker.io/ianayoung/shibboleth-mda-docker
```

In either case, you should receive output similar to the following:

```text
openjdk version "17.0.8.1" 2023-08-22 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Corretto-17.0.8.8.1 (build 17.0.8.1+8-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Corretto-17.0.8.8.1 (build 17.0.8.1+8-LTS, mixed mode, sharing)
Agent pid 39
user@C17: ~ $
```

At the prompt, invoke `mda.sh` to confirm that everything is working:

```bash
user@C17: ~ $ mda.sh --version
1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
```

You can now experiment with the latest MDA snapshot in a non-persistent
environment: everything you do will be removed when you exit the
container.

## Wiki examples

The directory `/opt/mda/doc` within the container is owned by the
command-line user. The `wiki` sub-directory may be of interest;
it contains the example files from the online documentation along
with additional data and scripts to allow them to be run in-place.

```bash
cd /opt/mda/doc/wiki
./run-all-examples.sh
```

Depending on your host environment, some of the examples may be unable
to run with the amount of heap space allowed to Java by default. You
can set this explicitly as follows:

```bash
JVMOPTS=-Xmx2G ./run-all-examples.sh
```

## Persistent state

If you would like to maintain state between runs, or work with
files created in the host environment, you should create a work
directory on the host and mount it as `/home/user` in the container.

The details of this depend on your host environment.

### Persistence with Docker Desktop for Mac

Docker Desktop for Mac runs your containers inside a custom
virtual machine, and handles all the details of mapping host
files automatically. This means that you can simply create a
host directory as your normal user and mount that:

```bash
$ mkdir user
$ touch user/from-the-host
$ docker run --rm -it -v ./user:/home/user \
    ianayoung/shibboleth-mda-docker
user@C17: ~ $ ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 0 Sep 25 14:32 from-the-host
```

Similarly, files created within the container will be accessable
from the host once the container has been stopped:

```bash
user@C17: ~ $ touch from-the-container
user@C17: ~ $ logout
$ ls -l user
total 0
-rw-r--r--  1 iay  staff  0 Sep 25 15:34 from-the-container
-rw-r--r--  1 iay  staff  0 Sep 25 15:32 from-the-host
```

### Persistence with Docker and Linux

If running `docker` on Linux, you're probably aware of how
interesting binding host directories can get. One simple route
is to run the container as `root` with the `user` directory
and files set to be owned by the 1000:1000 user within the container:

```bash
root@pi03:~# mkdir user
root@pi03:~# touch user/from-the-host
root@pi03:~# chown -R 1000:1000 user
root@pi03:~# docker run --rm -it -v ./user:/home/user \
    ianayoung/shibboleth-mda-docker
openjdk version "17.0.8.1" 2023-08-22 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Corretto-17.0.8.8.1 (build 17.0.8.1+8-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Corretto-17.0.8.8.1 (build 17.0.8.1+8-LTS, mixed mode, sharing)
Agent pid 49
user@C17: ~ $ ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 0 Sep 25 14:47 from-the-host
user@C17: ~ $ touch from-the-container
user@C17: ~ $ logout
root@pi03:~# ls -ln user
total 0
-rw-rw-r-- 1 1000 1000 0 Sep 25 14:48 from-the-container
-rw-r--r-- 1 1000 1000 0 Sep 25 14:47 from-the-host
```

There are other options, but this isn't the place to learn
how to deploy rootless Docker.

## Persistence with Podman and Enterprise Linux

Using `podman` on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 or 9 (or a
rebuild distribution such as Rocky Linux) works very similarly
to using Docker on other Linux systems with one additional
concern: you probably want to at least start out
by disabling SELinux.

```bash
[root@r9d ~]# setenforce 0
[root@r9d ~]# mkdir user
[root@r9d ~]# touch user/from-the-host
[root@r9d ~]# chown -R 1000:1000 user
[root@r9d ~]# podman run --rm -it -v ./user:/home/user \
    docker.io/ianayoung/shibboleth-mda-docker
openjdk version "17.0.8.1" 2023-08-22 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Corretto-17.0.8.8.1 (build 17.0.8.1+8-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Corretto-17.0.8.8.1 (build 17.0.8.1+8-LTS, mixed mode, sharing)
Agent pid 39
user@C17: ~ $ ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r--. 1 user user 0 Sep 25 15:13 from-the-host
user@C17: ~ $ touch from-the-container
user@C17: ~ $ logout
[root@r9d ~]# ls -l user
total 0
-rw-rw-r--. 1 ansible ansible 0 Sep 25 15:15 from-the-container
-rw-r--r--. 1 ansible ansible 0 Sep 25 15:13 from-the-host
[root@r9d ~]# ls -ln user
total 0
-rw-rw-r--. 1 1000 1000 0 Sep 25 15:15 from-the-container
-rw-r--r--. 1 1000 1000 0 Sep 25 15:13 from-the-host
```

Running `podman` in a rootless mode and with
SELinux active is probably possible but outside the
scope of this README.
